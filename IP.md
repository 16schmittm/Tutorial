#### What is an IP address?
1. An IP address is a number assigned to a specific device that allows it to communicate with other devices across the world.
   * Every device that connects to the internet has an IP address
   * The two types of IP addresses are IPv4 which looks like 172.16.1.1 and IPv6 which looks like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334.
2. An IP address is not permanently assigned to one device, meaning a your laptop might have an IP address of 192.168.110.57 one day, another day it could be 96.40.206.96.
